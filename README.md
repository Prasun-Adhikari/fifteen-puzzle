# 15 puzzle

The 15 puzzle is a sliding tile puzzle with 15 tiles in a 4x4 grid. The goal is to arrange the tiles in a specific order.\
The more general puzzle contains $n^2 - 1$ tiles in an $n*n$ grid.

In this case, I was attempting to solve the version of the puzzle that was a part of the mobile game [Exponential idle](https://conicgames.github.io/exponentialidle/index.html).\
This involved taking input and output from a phone screen as well as finding the right steps to actually solve the puzzle.
